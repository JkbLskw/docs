= Configuration for Swing

== Maven Setup

Your Swing application will need to add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>swing-kit-client</artifactId>
    <version>{swing-kit-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Environment Variables

When using MacOS or Linux, the following JVM Parameters must be added to run the application:

[source]
----
--add-opens java.desktop/sun.awt=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.desktop/sun.lwawt=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.desktop/sun.lwawt.macosx=ALL-UNNAMED
----

On Windows systems there is not such requirement.

=== Additional Note

The rendering process uses natives files which will be store in the home foleder of the system.
This file will be downloaded from the internet if not already present, this will likely happen silently the first time the swing application is executed.
