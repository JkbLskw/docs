= Exception Handling

== Overview

By default, any exception not handled by the remote View, will be sent to Swing to be handled by it.
As a default behaviour, Swing will show the exception in a JOptionPane`.
The behaviour can be changed to catch any Vaadin exceptions from Swing, directly.

== Manually Handle Vaadin Exceptions

A custom handler for the exception can be used after disabling the default behaviour with the following:
[source,java]
----
vaadinPanel.disableDefaultExceptionHandler();
----

You would add a custom handler for the exception by added this:

[source,java]
----
vaadinPanel.addEventListener(EventType.EXCEPTION, event -> {
    // Print to standard output the exception content
    System.out.println(event.getParams().get("content"));
});
----

Notice that the event will contain only `String` values instead of the original `Exception`.
This is to avoid serialization errors due to different classpaths from the Vaadin server and the Swing application.
