= Getting Started with AppSec Kit

AppSec Kit monitors your application dependencies for vulnerabilities and lets you visualize detail on found vulnerabilities and store your analysis to share it with other developers.

== Step-by-step guide on how to use AppSec Kit in an application

=== 1. Add the AppSec Kit Dependency

To get started, you need to add AppSec Kit as a dependency to an application. For example, to add to a Maven project, do something like this:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>appsec-kit-v8</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

=== 2. Add the cyclonedx-maven-plugin

To be able to monitor the application dependencies the AppSec Kit needs a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) file which contains information about the dependencies (and their transitives).
To generate the SBOM file, you need to add the link:https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-maven-plugin[cyclonedx-maven-plugin] to the plugins:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.cyclonedx</groupId>
    <artifactId>cyclonedx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.7</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <phase>generate-resources</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>makeAggregateBom</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <projectType>library</projectType>
        <schemaVersion>1.4</schemaVersion>
        <includeBomSerialNumber>true</includeBomSerialNumber>
        <includeCompileScope>true</includeCompileScope>
        <includeProvidedScope>true</includeProvidedScope>
        <includeRuntimeScope>true</includeRuntimeScope>
        <includeSystemScope>true</includeSystemScope>
        <includeTestScope>false</includeTestScope>
        <includeLicenseText>false</includeLicenseText>
        <outputReactorProjects>true</outputReactorProjects>
        <outputFormat>json</outputFormat>
        <outputName>bom</outputName>
        <outputDirectory>${project.build.outputDirectory}/resources</outputDirectory>
        <verbose>false</verbose>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

The SBOM file should be generated under the `/resources` in the project's output directory in `json` format with the `bom` file name. The plugin is already configured to do so.

=== 3. Start the Application

The AppSec Kit is not enabled in production mode, so you need to start your application in debug mode (or development mode).
By default, the Vaadin 8 applications start in link:https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/framework/application/application-environment#application.environment.parameters.production-mode[debug mode], so you don't need to enable this explicitly.
To start the application run the following command:

----
mvn jetty:run
----

=== 4. Open the AppSec Kit UI

After the application has started the AppSec Kit analyzes the dependencies, collects the vulnerabilities, if any exists, and displays a notification dialog where you can open the UI.
