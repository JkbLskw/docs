= Playwright

If you prefer writing end-to-end tests in TypeScript, you might like using https://playwright.dev/[Playwright].

This section is about setting up end-to-end tests for the Hilla application. You can find detailed information in the https://playwright.dev/[Playwright documentation].

[TIP]
If you prefer writing end-to-end tests in Java, you can instead use Vaadin TestBench. Setting up end-to-end tests with Vaadin TestBench is described in the <<testbench#, TestBench documentation>>.



== Preparation

To prepare to do some end-to-end testing, run the following at the command-line in your application's root:

.Terminal
[source,bash]
----
npm init playwright@latest
----

Now answer the questions and wait until Playwright has initialized.


== Test Suites

Consider an application with the following entities:

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/hilla/testing/UsersEndpoint.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/hilla/testing/User.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/hilla/testing/UserRepository.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----

At the frontend side, the home page prints all available users to a list.

ifdef::lit[]

[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/src/main/resources/hilla/testing/frontend/lit/users-page.ts[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----

endif::lit[]
ifdef::react[]

[source,typescriptjsx]
----
include::{root}/src/main/java/com/vaadin/demo/hilla/testing/UserRepository.java[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----

endif::react[]

To add the first test, create a file in the directory you specified for Playwright. Replace `tests` in the paths of the command with the path of your directory.

[.example]
--
[source,bash]
----
<source-info group="Unix"></source-info>
touch tests/UsersPage.test.ts
----

[source,bash]
----
<source-info group="Windows"></source-info>
echo nul > tests\UsersPage.test.ts
----
--

Now you can add some tests for `UsersPage`.

[source,typescript]
----
include::{root}/src/main/resources/hilla/testing/e2e/UsersPage.test.ts[tags=snippet,indent=0]
----
