= Testing

Testing is an essential part of software development. For applications, tests are usually divided into unit tests and end-to-end tests. However, for Hilla, it becomes more challenging because the application consists of two separate parts: the frontend written in TypeScript; and the backend written in Java.

Both TypeScript and Java have specific tools for writing and performing unit tests. Fortunately, end-to-end testing does not require such separation.

This documentation section covers the approach Vaadin recommends for testing the Hilla application.

However, this is only a recommendation. You could choose any solution that fits your requirements, and it'll work with the Hilla application.
