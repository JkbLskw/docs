= Testing

Testing is an essential part of software development.
For applications, tests are usually divided into unit tests and end-to-end tests.
However, for Hilla, it becomes more challenging because the application consists of two separate parts: the frontend written in TypeScript, and the backend written in Java.
Each of these languages has specific tools for writing and performing unit tests.
Fortunately, end-to-end testing does not require such separation.

This documentation section covers the approach we recommend for testing the Hilla application.

Note that it is a recommendation.
You could choose any solution that fits your requirements, and it will work with the Hilla application.
